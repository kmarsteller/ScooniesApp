            <p>Welcome to The <font color="red">Scoonies</font>! But what IS a <font color="red">Scoonie</font>?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Named after Ohio State standout and tournament darling, <font color="red">Scoonie</font> Penn, <b>The <font color="red">Scoonies</font></b> brings an aspect of fantasy sports to March Madness. In the <font color="red">Scoonies</font>, each player drafts a roster(s) of teams based on a limited budget, and that entry is called a <i><font color="red">Scoonie</font></i>.
            <br><br>
            <p><h4><b>Selection:</b></h4> Each participant starts with 200 points to spend on picking sets of teams, with each individual team's cost based on its seed value. 1-seeds cost 80 points, and the cost for each lower seed decreases by 5 points per step down: 2-seeds cost 75, 3-seeds cost 70, and 16-seeds cost just 5 points each. You must spend exactly 200 points on your selections. Get started and <a href="/submit.html">Make a Scoonie!</a></p>
            <br>

            <p><b><h4>Scoring:</b></h4> Teams can earn points in two ways: Advancement Points and Bonus Points. <br>
            <i><u><b>Advancement Points:</b></u></i> For each game one of your teams win, they earn Advacement Points equal to their seed number(1-16) multiplied by the round number they win in(1-6). For as long as a team survives, they accumulate the sum of all their Advancement Points. <br>
            <p><code><b>Advancement Points Example:</b> A 12-seed that reaches the Elite Eight and then loses would earn: ((12 Ã— 1)+(12 x 2)+(12 x 3)) = 72 points.</code><br><br>

            <i><u><b>Bonus Points:</b></u></i> Bonus points are earned for reaching key milestones: +5 for making the Final Four(FF), +10 for reaching the Championship Game(CG), and +15 for winning it all(WIN). </p><br>
        
            <p><code><b>Bonus Points Example:</b> A 1-seed that goes all the way and wins the NCAA Championship would earn: (((1X1)+(1x2)+(1x3)+(1x4)+(1x5)+(1x6)) + (5 FF + 10 CG + 15 WIN)) = 51 points.</code><br><br>
            <p>Teams that lose maintain their totals, but stop scoring points. The final score for a <font color="red">Scoonie</font> is the sum of all points earned by your set of selections. <br><br>

            <p><h4>Winning</h4>Entries are ranked by highest total score, and you can submit multiple entries with different team combinations. Each entry will cost you $20, payable to Proximo via Venmo or PayPal at the time you submit your <font color="red">Scoonie</font>.<br> Prize distribution amounts will be announced before the tournament begins. Your payment status will be visible on the <a href="/standings.html"> Standings</a> page.

            <br><p><b><font color="red"> YOU MUST PAY BY THE START OF THE TOURNAMENT, OR YOUR ENTRY/ENTRIES WILL BE DELETED!</b></font></p><br>
