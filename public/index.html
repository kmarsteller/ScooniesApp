            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Welcome to The Scoonies, our NCAA Tournament selection game! </p>
            <br>
            <p>Team Selection: Each participant starts with 200 points to spend on picking teams, with costs based on seed values: 1 seeds cost 80 points, and each lower seed decreases by 5 points (2 seeds cost 75, 3 seeds cost 70, etc.) down to 16 seeds at just 5 points each. You must spend exactly 200 points on your selections.</p> 
            <br>

            <p>Scoring: As the tournament progresses, your teams earn points equal to their seed number multiplied by the round they win in (Round of 32 = 1, Sweet 16 = 2, etc.), plus bonus points for reaching key milestones: +5 for making the Final Four, +10 for reaching the Championship game, and +15 for winning it all. </p>
            <br>

            <p>For example, a 12 seed that reaches the Elite Eight would earn 12 Ã— 3 = 36 points. Teams that lose are eliminated, and your final score is the sum of all points earned by your selections. Entries are ranked by highest total score, and you can submit multiple entries with different team combinations. Each entry will cost you $10, payable to Proximo via Venmo or PayPal.<b>YOU MUST PAY BY THE START OF THE TOURNAMENT, OR YOUR ENTRY/ENTRIES WILL BE DELETED!</b></p>
            <br>

            <p> To get an in-depth look at what The Scoonies is, how it started, and how to play like a pro, listen to the Talking Scoonies Podcast (presented by the A League of Inches podcast network)! </p>
